# The Fundamentals of Lyman Alpha Exoplanet Transits
## Owen et al 2021

### Background
*What are things I learned in order to understand this paper?*

 - Mass-loss from primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres is one of the dominant evolutionary drivers of planets with orbital periods less than 100 days.

### Scientific Purpose
*What is the science question addressed by the paper?*

 - To develop the fundamental physical framework for Lyman-α transits in which escaping hydrogen is shaped into a cometary tail receding from the planet by tidal forces and interactions with the circumstellar environment.
 - How is neutral hydrogen injected into the tail ionized, and if it becomes ionized, how is it recombined? How is the tail radially accelerated toward the observer?

### Methods
*What is the method used to address the science question?*

 - Outflow model is a cylindrical tail into which mass is injected from atmospheric escape.
    - Injected gas is neutral H.
    - Ionization as a function of position in the tail gives the transit depth and duration
    - Stellar wind accelerates the tail radially, which establishes velocity-position zones in which you get a detectable transit
 - After establishing the model, quantitative examples are calculated using a hot Jupiter-like system and a sub-Neptune system.


### Citeable Results
*A list of citeable results in the paper*

 - Higher irradiation levels, which are expected to drive more powerful outflows, produce weaker, shorter Lyman-α transits.
     - This is because the fundamental controlling physics is not the mass-loss rate but the distance a neutral hydrogen atom can travel before it's photoionized
 - A detectable Lyman-α transit requires the escaping planetary gas to be radially accelerated to velocities of ∼100 km s<sup>−1</sup> before it becomes too ionized
 - For sun-like stars, stellar wind accelerates the Lya tail radially, leading to absorption at velocities around -100 km/s in the blue wing
 - Long Lya transits are associated with weak irradiation levels (500 erg/s/cm2), since the ionization rate of neutral H is slow enough to allow it to *remain* neutral out to 100s of planetary radii, yet it is still able to be accelerated efficiently by the stellar wind.

### Derivations
*Derivations of any critical equations that appear in the paper*

 - Tail geometry is estimated using dimensional analysis on Coriolis force, Keplerian shear, etc. Agrees with what would be obtained in HSE (c<sub>s</sub> / omega).
