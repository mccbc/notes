# Resonant-line radiative transfer within power-law density profiles
## Lao & Smith (2020)

### Background
*What are things I learned in order to understand this paper?*

 - Resonant scattering is characterized by random walks inthe wings of the line profile, with an average drift back to the core of -1/x and an rms frequency displacement of 1 (Osterbrock 1962)

### Scientific Purpose
*What is the science question addressed by the paper?*

 - To present idealized but physically-motivated scenarios to extend the existing solution to new analtic solutions, including a closed-form solution for the radiation field and derived quantities

### Methods
*What is the method used to address the science question?*

 - 

### Citeable Results
*A list of citeable results in the paper*

 - A general expression for arbitrary density profiles in spherical geometry cannot be provided because the eigenfunction expansion is coupled to the spatial dependence of the absorption coefficient
 - Generalize sphere and slab solutions to arbitrary power-law density and emissivity profiles


### Discussion and Concerns
*Are there any red flags?*

 - Figure 12 demonstrates the exact discrepancy at the peak of the spectrum that our solution corrects for.
