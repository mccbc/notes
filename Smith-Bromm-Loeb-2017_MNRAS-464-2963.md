# Lyman α radiation hydrodynamics of galactic winds before cosmic reionization
## Smith, Bromm & Loeb (2017)

### Background
*What are things I learned in order to understand this paper?*

 - Lya radiation pressure can have a dynamic impact on galaxy formation, but this effect depend son the rate and duration of momentum transfer between the photons and the neutral hydrogen gas
 - Lya radiation pressure is a cell face quantity, rather than a cell interior quantity like energy density and radiation force (?)

### Scientific Purpose
*What is the science question addressed by the paper?*

 - What is the dynamic effect of Lya radiation pressure in galaxy formation? How does Lya feedback and winds affect the observed Lya luminosity and spectrum?

### Methods
*What is the method used to address the science question?*

 - Lya radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of high redshift galaxy environments are performed, coupling a cosmic Lya transfer code with spherically symmetric hydrodynamics.
 - Additional functionality is introduced to COLT which is tested "in preparation for fully-coupled RHD". 

### Citeable Results
*A list of citeable results in the paper*

 - Continuous momentum deposition is required to determine gas coupling (I believe we are going to do this with our acceleration scheme)
 - 1-D RHD framework is developed for radiatively-driven outflows during the formation of high-redshift galaxies
     -  First hydrodynamical study incorporating accurate MCRT calculations of Lya feedback
     -  Multiple scatterings within high HI column density shells is capable of significantly enhancing the effective Lya force
 - Lya radiation pressure may have a significant dynamical impact on gas surrounding direct collapse blach holes
